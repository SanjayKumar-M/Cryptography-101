# Cryptography 101

🔐 Welcome to Cryptography 101, where we embark on a journey into the fascinating world of cryptography! 🚀

Are you curious about how secret messages are created, passwords are protected, and digital signatures are used for verification? This repository is your gateway to exploring the basics of cryptography through hands-on Java projects. 🤖

## What's Inside?

This repository hosts a collection of Cryptographic concepts, each designed to help you understand fundamental concepts in a fun and interactive way. Get ready to dive into:

## Focused on Asymmetric Encryption and Hash Functions since this is related to Blockchain 

1. **Caesar Cipher** Shift characters to create secret messages.
2. **SHA2** SHA 2 based Hash functions.
3. **SHA3** Crack codes using frequency analysis.
4. **OTP (One-Time Pad) Generator:** Create ultra-secure keys.
5. **Password Manager:** Safeguard passwords using encryption.
6. **Random Key Generator:** Produce cryptographic keys.
7. **Digital Signature Generator:** Sign messages with keys.
8. **Hashing Tool:** Hash your inputs using MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256.
9. **Secure File Transfer:** Encrypt files before sending.
10. **Secure Chat Application:** Send secret messages using encryption.
